## mission
mission:
  title: Mission
  subtitle: To revolutionize the way development teams operate.
  content: Businesses today need a viable Platform-as-a-Product solution to innovate, collaborate, and deliver exceptional software products efficiently. Sadly not many vendor platforms provide the right balance of flexibility and control to both devs and admin staff. SkyU addresses the diverse needs of modern development workflows by offering a scalable and customizable platform that unifies and serves needs of the entire IT factory.
  problem: With growing demand for cloud and emergence of multiple cloud providers, it is difficult to manage compute resources across different platform. Moreover the cost for running these compute resources for different development environments is not so cheap.
  solution: Our skyU platform allows organization to manage all cloud compute resources in one place across different providers and regions. With our efficient scheduler, organization can time box the compute resources and save significant cloud compute usage, thereby the size of cloud bill.

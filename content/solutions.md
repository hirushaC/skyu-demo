    title: Platform Teams
    subtitle: Reduce cloud-native complexities, set guidelines, and make the infrastructure transparent to your developers.
    ftitle: The future is “platform-as-a-product” and clear guidance for “collaboration” or “self-service” instances where teams should interact.
    fsubtitle: Imagine your work without these issues.

        - title: SkyU enables operational readiness
          paragraph: Platform and infrastructure teams are pivotal in providing the foundational infrastructure and tools for effective application development, deployment, and scaling. Internal developer platforms empower these teams to streamline operations, enhance scalability, and drive organizational success. Here's how internal developer platforms impact platform and infrastructure teams
          section:
          - subtitle: Streamlining Infrastructure Management
            content: Internal developer platforms simplify infrastructure management by offering centralized tools and automation capabilities. They enable platform teams to efficiently provision, configure, and manage infrastructure resources, reducing manual overhead and streamlining operations.
          - subtitle: Standardizing Development Environments
            content:  Internal developer platforms provide standardized development environments across development, testing, and production. This ensures consistency and repeatability, with platform teams enforcing infrastructure-as-code practices for reliable environments throughout the software development lifecycle.
          - subtitle: Enhancing Scalability and Resilience
            content: In modern cloud-native architectures, scalability and resilience are critical. Internal developer platforms offer auto-scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance tools, enabling platform teams to design and manage highly scalable and resilient infrastructure solutions.
          - subtitle: Facilitating Self-Service Provisioning
            content: Internal developer platforms empower development teams with self-service capabilities for provisioning and managing infrastructure resources. APIs, templates, and pre-configured environments provided by platform teams enable independent deployment of applications, accelerating time-to-market.
          - subtitle: Enabling Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
            content: CI/CD pipelines automate the software delivery process and foster a culture of continuous integration and deployment. Internal developer platforms seamlessly integrate CI/CD capabilities with infrastructure management tools, automating testing, build, and deployment processes for frequent and reliable software updates.
          - subtitle: Promoting Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing
            content: Collaboration and knowledge sharing are vital for platform and infrastructure teams. Internal developer platforms facilitate collaboration through shared documentation, code repositories, and communication channels. They empower teams to share best practices, troubleshoot issues, and collaborate effectively on infrastructure projects.

      - title: While every IDP is different, top performing platform engineering teams have clear things in common.
        paragraph: Developers have a lot to deal with. There is the time-consuming nature of manual tasks such as environment setup, alongside the barriers. Silos don’t help communication and teamwork either. Balancing feature development with the maintenance of code quality and scalability adds another layer of complexity, often resulting in technical debt. Moreover, the lack of visibility into project keep them in an eternal loop of inefficiencies and delays. Productivity and project success takes a hit.
